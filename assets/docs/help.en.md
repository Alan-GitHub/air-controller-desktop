# FAQ
1) The mobile app is opened, but it still can't be searched in computer.

Follow the steps to find the cause of the problem:

* Make sure your mobile and computer connected to the same network.
* Try to restart your mobile app.
* Try to restart your desktop app if it's still not being searched.

2) Stuck when copying files to computer.

As copying multiple files needs compress to zip file first, it will take a long time if the files are too much,
the desktop app will always be showing "compressing".

So if you need to copy multiple files, instead use [FileTransfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) to do this job, please.
