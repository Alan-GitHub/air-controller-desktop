# Build and run.

1. Install the latest Flutter SDK on your computer.

This project is developed by the Flutter framework. You should install Flutter first on your computer.

Make sure:

* You have installed the latest Flutter SDK.

* You have installed the latest Dart SDK.

* No errors when using the command "flutter doctor".



2. Install dependencies and add desktop support.

Use the command `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.

Use the command `flutter config --enable-<platform>-desktop` to add desktop support.



Use a specific platform name to replace the string "-<platform>-" in the middle.

Eg: `flutter config -enable-linux-desktop` to add support for the Linux platform.



3. Build

The build command is `flutter build <platform>`.

Same as above, use a specific platform name to replace the string "<platform>", then you will get the final binary file.

Attention: you need to build it on the computer running the same platform. Eg: Building a Windows platform binary file needs to use a Windows PC.
